# Project Overview

## Project Description

I work for a digital asset exchange and custodian called Gemini (www.gemini.com). We have an educational "What is Bitcoin?" deck/presentation that I would like to turn into an interactive Gemini-branded site where you can scroll to see the timeline of Bitcoin and explanation of the technology and concepts it uses.

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

| Site Url        | Desired Features           | 
| ------------- |-------------|  
| http://alightyear.com/ | timeline that scrolls and reflects year as you scroll down, gradient change with scroll, objects transition in/out with scroll. i also like the layout with the date persistently on the right or left. |  
| https://welcometotheuniverse.net/#our-place-in-the-universe | animated SVG's, scrolljacking (as opposed to scroll x amount to next event)  |   
| http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/ | not inspiration per se but a jquery plugin for scrolling |
| http://inception-explained.com/ | text appears/disappears based on scroll |

## Wireframes

Include wireframes for all pages included in the site including:

### Landing Page

#### Desktop

#### Tablet

#### Mobile

(SEE IMAGES IN FOLDER)

## MVP 

Include the full list of features that you will implement as part of your site's MVP:

- start and finish page 
- scroll determines year displayed
- year changes fluidly, and milestone appears/reappears based on scroll position
- gradient change as scroll (depending on final designs) (http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/)

## POST MVP

- display value of bitcoin that updates with scroll/based on year
- display month as well as year (month determined by scroll)
- buttons to jump ahead to the next event in the timeline (instead of forcing the user to scroll and scroll and scroll....)
- additional imagery
- animated SVGs
- nav bar with links to my squarespace, gemini.com, and a link to open....
- whole page "about"
