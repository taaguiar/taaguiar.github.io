# Project Overview

## Project Description

I work for a digital asset exchange and custodian called Gemini (gemini.com). We have an educational "What is Bitcoin?" deck/presentation that I would like to turn into an interactive Gemini-branded site where you can scroll to see the timeline of Bitcoin and explanation of the technology and concepts it uses.

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

| Site Url        | Desired Features           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| [GeneralAssembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)| - layout of the start learning section <br> - layout of the choose your path section | 
| http://alightyear.com/ | timeline that scrolls and reflects year as you scroll down, gradient change with scroll, objects transition in/out with scroll. i also like the layout with the date persistently on the right or left. |  
| https://welcometotheuniverse.net/#our-place-in-the-universe | animated SVG's, scrolljacking (as opposed to scroll x amount to next event)  |   
| http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/ | not inspiration per se but a jquery plugin for scrolling |
| http://inception-explained.com/ | text appears/disappears based on scroll |
